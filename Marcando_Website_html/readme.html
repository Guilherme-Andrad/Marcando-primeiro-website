    <h1>WorldWideWeb distributed code</h1>
    <p>See the CERN copyright . This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar files.<br>
        These files contain information about hypertext, hypertext systems, and the WorldWideWeb project.<br>
        If you have taken this with a .tar file, you will have only a subset of the files.
        THIS FILE IS A VERY ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE WEB. IF IN DOUBT, READ THE WEB DIRECTLY.<br>
        If you have not got any browser installed, do this by telnet to info.cern.ch (no username or password).</p>
